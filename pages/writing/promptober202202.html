                    A Traumaspa contains many similarities to its counterpart; bleach-white lights, deep, all-encompassing baths, and well-mannered staff that attend your every moment. The difference lies in what happens at the moment of total relaxation. Traumaspas are a popular service for the absolute worst of sadists, as once a subject has completely lowered their guard, they are snatched up by humming machines and soothing voices, and their open mind is supplanted with all number of overwhelming terrors.

                    "I'm sooo glad we decided against going." The lady sighed, nonchalantly. You sat quivering in her lap, terrified to move, for the fear that any twitch would spell your death. Your stomach dropped as her fingers raked calmly through your scalp. "It just doesn't have that personal touch, you know?"
                    
                    "..."
                    
                    Your eyes shrunk to pinpricks as your chin was grabbed firmly. The sharp touch of her fingernails made your nervous system ignite with a fiery, primal horror. The sickly feeling of a thousand traumatic memories coursed through your veins.
                    "I asked you a question."
                    Too paralyzed paralyzed for real thought, your body acted on instinct for survival's sake, and you told her what you want to hear.
                    "Yes, yes!" You gasped, words choked out just shy of a shout.
                    "Oh good, so you enjoy it when I'm the one to ruin that pretty little head of yours?"
                    Once more, without thought: "Yes!"
                    "And won't it be nice when I delve deep and <b>yank</b> out every last one of those nasty memories myself?" She dangled hope in front of you like an angler fish's lure.
                    "Yes- God yes." Tears are streaming down your face as you beg for a release from this nightmare. You remember how things used to be, but they're muddied by a thousand virtual lifetimes of torture between then and now.
                    "That's what I thought. Then let's start by taking a <i>deep breath.</i>"
                    You do as she commands, and your world goes blank. Sweet, blissful emptiness.
                    "I'll leave just a few." She whispers to your limp form with a dark smile. "Don't ever forget what I'm capable of."
