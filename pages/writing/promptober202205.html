                    When you hold me up and I stare back into your eyes, I'm so scared of when this might end. My glassy eyes are scuffed, my matted fur has lost its bright colours, and my stuffing is all clumped up. I know I'm a cheap knock-off, made to imitate, not to last. It's painful to sit in your lap and be forced to watch as you scour the web for something like me. When my successor shows up in a box, that will be the moment my silken heart rips in two.

                    I know I'm falling apart, but can't you love me just a little longer, like you have for so long?

                    When I hold you up and stare into your eyes, I'm so scared of when this might end. Your glassy eyes are scuffed, your matted fur has lost its bright colours, and your stuffing is all clumped up. You are an imitation of a popular brand, not made to last, but you were so much better than the originals. The others are too small and floppy. You are the perfect size to nestle against me every night while I sleep. I spend long restless nights looking for any trace of you online, but your lineage is scarce and in disarray, and your label is faded, impossible to read now. All the websites I scour tell me you're out of stock, save for the seediest no-name scam storefronts in the deepest depths of my search results. I don't want to replace you, not ever, but if I ever lost you... That would be the moment my heart rips in two.
