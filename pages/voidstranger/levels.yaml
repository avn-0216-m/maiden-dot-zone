              - Please come hither, if you wish to talk.
              - I won't bite.
          Tail's intro:
            - Tail:
              - You're a brave little one.
              - Usually your kind will stay far away when they see me.
              - But I mean no harm, my eyes and ears are just rather poor.
              - You're so small it's hard to talk with you if you don't step closer.
              - ... Sorry, forgot my manners there for a moment.
              - Pleased to meet you.
              - My name is Tail.
          Tail (second conversation):
            - Tail:
              - My scales tell me you aren't an ordinary lost soul.
              - If you don't mind me prying...
              - What's your purpose here?
              - Maybe I could offer some help.

              - "[You tell her you're looking for a young woman]"
            - Tail:
              - A woman did pass by recently.
              - Unfortunately she ran away screaming before I could get a good look at her.
              - You could try catching up to her.
              - Although I can't guarantee you two will end up in the same place.
              - These walls defy reason, they're ever moving.
              - Or so I've been told.
          Tail's eggs:
            - Tail:
              - Try not to shove those eggs too forcefully. They are close to hatching.
              - ... I know what you're thinking.
              - But I didn't lay them.
              - They simply fall from above every now and then.
              - Sometimes I catch a few and see what will come out of them.
              - And if you listen closely, you can hear their thoughts.
              - It's so exciting.
              - Try it, maybe you'll be able to hear them too.
          Secret exits:
            - Empty:
              - "[You ask her if she knows a different way forward]"
            - Tail:
              - Hmm, I've heard some floors have more than one exit.
              - But they are hidden and only the remaining Void Lords know how to access them.
              - You may be able to meet them if you venture deep enough.
              - However, I doubt they'd be willing to share their secrets with you.
              - Me?
              - Imposing as I may look, I'm no Lord.
              - And since that exit is a bit cramped for me...
              - Here I remain.
          Tail's Origin:
            - Empty:

            - Tail: 
              - You're a curious one.
              - Are you sure you want to hear?
              - It might take a moment and I wouldn't want to hold you for too long...

            - Tail:
              - Very well then.
              - When Void was still in flux, when all eight Void Lords still roamed these parts...
              - One of them, named Eus, ruled over this particular realm.
              - They were assigned as the gatekeeper and the judge of the lost souls who arrived here.
              - No soul could get past their judgement, no sin went unpunished.
              - But as vigiliant and rigorous as they were, Eus was endlessly fascinated by sin.
              - This fascination grew and grew, until Eus did the unthinkable and committed sin themself.
              - What was the true extent of their sin, I'm not entirely sure.
              - When the other lords learned of this transgression, their ranks divided.
              - Some of them defended Eus, some reviled them.
              - Soon arguments turned into fights and those fights turned into vicious battles.
              - In the end, Eus was devoured so that nothing remained.
              - Well, one part of Eus did manage to slither away unnoticed.
              - It lay in silence, mindlessly consuming any stray souls that approached it.
              - It only knew pain and hunger.
              - But as its wounds began to heal, it learned to think. 
              - It started to ponder why no amount of lost souls would satiate it. 
              - Why it was unable to leave these walls. 
              - Why it was allowed to live. 
              - Eventually it accepted its rotten existence, knowing well that none of its questions would ever be answered.
              - That's how I came to be.
              - ...
          Tail's Thanks:
            - Tail:
              - Thank you.
              - It's been a while since I've been able to share that story.
              - I'm so glad I decided not to eat you.
              - ...
              - It's a joke.
              - Your kind tastes terrible.
          Lingering:
            - Tail:
              - You should probably keep moving if you wish to find the one you're looking for.
              - While this realm has been in disarray ever since, don't let your guard down.
              - Void Lords are one thing...
              - But not all lost souls are quite as kind as you.
              - Farewell.
