                - As you might've notice, traveling through these halls can get rather tiresome.

                - But it seems awfully convenient, don't you think?
                - Just believe in *** and in the end everything will be alright.

                - You could try catching up to her.
                - Although I can't guarantee you two will end up in the same place.

                - Me?
                - Imposing as I may look, I'm no Lord.

                - When Void was still in flux, when all eight Void Lords still roamed these parts...
                - One of them, named Eus, ruled over this particular realm.
                - They were assigned as the gatekeeper and the judge of the lost souls who arrived here.
                - No soul could get past their judgement, no sin went unpunished.
                - But as vigiliant and rigorous as they were, Eus was endlessly fascinated by sin.
                - This fascination grew and grew, until Eus did the unthinkable and committed sin themself.
                - What was the true extent of their sin, I'm not entirely sure.
                - When the other lords learned of this transgression, their ranks divided.
                - Some of them defended Eus, some reviled them.
                - Soon arguments turned into fights and those fights turned into vicious battles.
                - In the end, Eus was devoured so that nothing remained.
                - Well, one part of Eus did manage to slither away unnoticed.
                - It lay in silence, mindlessly consuming any stray souls that approached it.
                - It only knew pain and hunger.
                - But as its wounds began to heal, it learned to think.
                - It started to ponder why no amount of lost souls would satiate it.
                - Why it was unable to leave these walls.
                - Why it was allowed to live.

              - Long ago, they and the other Lords had a big fight.
              - I didn't want anything to do with it but was pulled in regardless.
              - As a punishment, Add cut off my body.
              - So when I heard they had left this realm, I felt hopeless.
              - For only they could grant me my eternal rest.
              - Some rumour said Add hid their treasures within these walls before they left, but I couldn't bring myself to believe it...
              - Until you showed up.
              - I want you to find Add's sword, the Void Blade.
              - Only that can kill me.
              - If I had to guess, you probably won't just find it lying about.
              - Add most likely hid it in one of the secret passageways.
              - Mere mortals can't normally access them...
              - That's where that Void Rod comes in.
              - You should be able to enter the hidden routes with a special incantation.

            - You can use the Void Rod, can't you?
            - I got my hopes up...
            - ... For nothing?!

            - I couldn't kill that lazy donkey even if I tried.
            - Besides...
            - Death would be way too kind for someone who freely tattles about our secrets.
            - Yes.
            - I know you've been snooping around in places you don't belong, mortal.
            - Trust me, if it was up to me...
            - YOU'D BE DEAD MEAT BY NOW.

        Notes: A giant carcass can be found by following the sound of dull howl. Punching it 10 times will cause a bell to toll for thee. If you accept its call, a cutscene showing an old Dr. Lily in a research facility that appears to be in the Abyss. Afterwards, the game will reset.

        Notes: Accessible by entering your own brand in any of the brand rooms. I find it easiest to do in DIS's brand room (B227). Punching the womb will light up the screen.

          - TrueTail:
            - Indeed.
            - How long has it been?
            - Two, three hundred years?
            - I hope I haven't angered you...
          - Cif:
            - Calm down.
            - I'm not after you.
            - Speaking of...
        Bee?:
          - Cif:
            - Have you seen Bee around here?
          - TrueTail:
            - Hmm, they did come here and tell me not to speak with strangers.
            - But that was a good while ago.
            - Have they gone missing?
          - Cif:
            - Don't worry about it.
            - I'll find them eventually.
          - TrueTail:
            - Maybe Gor knows something?
          - Cif:
            - I doubt it.
            - They're probably sleeping, as usual.
          - TrueTail:
            - Hmm...
        Mon?:
          - Cif:
            - Was there anything else?
          - TrueTail:
            - I'm not sure if this is of any help to you, but...
            - Someone else did pass by earlier.
          - Cif:
            - What about it?
          - TrueTail:
            - It was Mon.
          - Cif:
            - Mon?
            - Are you certain?
          - TrueTail:
            - I didn't see them properly.
            - They were groping my scales.
            - I don't usually mind that much.
            - Yet something about their touch made me feel uncomfortable.
            - Like I had felt something similar before.
            - It's certainly Mon.
          - Cif:
            - ...
            - Did they talk to you?
          - TrueTail:
            - No, but they were muttering something.
            - About heading towards The Seventh Circle.
          - Cif:
            - Lev's territory...
          - TrueTail:
            - You sound concerned.
          - Cif:
            - Mon should be dead.
            - Lev themself killed them back then...
            - Or so I thought.
            - Something doesn't add up.
            - ...
            - Worrying does us little good.
            - Just stay vigilant for now.
          - TrueTail:
            - I'll do my best...
        Lingering:
          - TrueTail:
