            <h1>Welcome to the <a href="/index.html">Maiden Zone</a></h1>
            <h2>Domain</h2>
            <p><code>maiden.zone</code> was purchased from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap,</a> which true to its name offered a price $10 to $20 dollars cheaper than other registrars. It also includes free WHOIS privacy so I don't have to dox myself just to make a fun website.</p>
            <h2>Hosting</h2>
            <p>My first choice for hosting was recommended by <a href="https://bawk.space/"> a friend</a> who also uses it, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean,</a> but site admins locked my account immediately after I created it for reasons unknown, so I went with <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> instead. I am currently using a <code>Linode Shared CPU (2 GB)</code> to host this website.</p>
            <h2>Software</h2>
            <p>I use <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a> to serve web pages. It's easy to set up and doesn't require much configuration.</p>
